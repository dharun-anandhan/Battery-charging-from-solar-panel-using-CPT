# 🌞 Solar Energy Battery System in Cisco Packet Tracer

## 📌 Aim
To design and simulate a solar-powered energy system in **Cisco Packet Tracer** where a **Solar Panel** charges a **Battery** through a **Power Meter**, demonstrating the concept of renewable energy storage.

---

## 🏆 Results
- Solar Panel was successfully connected to the Power Meter and Battery using IoT Power Cables.  
- At 100% sunlight in the Environment Editor, the Solar Panel generated up to **136 W** of power.  
- The Power Meter displayed the energy input from the Solar Panel and the output directed to the Battery.  
- The Battery’s charge percentage increased gradually, confirming successful energy storage from the Solar source.
